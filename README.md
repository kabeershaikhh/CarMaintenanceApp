            General Info
Project Name: Vehicle Maintenance Tracker

            Elevator Pitch:
A smart companion for vehicle owners to record maintenance and repairs and ensure your vehicles stay in top condition.

*About the Project*
             Inspiration:
Managing vehicle maintenance manually can be overwhelming and lead to missed repairs or servicing. We wanted to create an app to simplify this process and ensure users never miss an important maintenance task.

             What it does:
The app allows users to:

•	Save details of vehicles they own (make, model, year, etc.).
•	Log maintenance and repair records (oil changes, part replacements, etc.).

            How we built it:
The app is developed using:
•	Kotlin as the primary programming language.
•	Android Jetpack libraries for modern and efficient app development.
•	Gradle for project configuration and dependency management.
•	Android Studio as the development environment.

            Challenges we ran into:
•	Implementing a flexible database structure to accommodate various vehicle types and their specific maintenance needs.
•	Designing an intuitive UI that simplifies input without overwhelming the user.
•	Managing time effectively while integrating and testing all the features.

            Accomplishments that we're proud of:
•	A clean and user-friendly interface.
•	Successfully deploying a robust backend to handle diverse user data.

            What we learned:
•	The importance of user-centric design when dealing with complex input fields.
•	Advanced features of Android Jetpack, such as Room for database management and WorkManager for handling reminders.
•	How to troubleshoot and optimize app performance.

            What's next for Vehicle Maintenance Tracker:
•	Adding barcode scanning for quick input of part replacements.
•	Integrating with GPS to suggest nearby service centers.
•	Introducing analytics for users to track spending and identify patterns in maintenance.

            Built With
•	Languages: Kotlin
•	Frameworks: Android Jetpack Libraries (Room, LiveData, ViewModel, WorkManager)
•	Platforms: Android Studio, Gradle
•	Database: Room (SQLite under the hood)
